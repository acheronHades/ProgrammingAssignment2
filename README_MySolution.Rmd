## Overview

Apparently, this is based on the makeVector example, but I used solve() instead of mean().
I still have problems when creating a matrix first (e.g. x <- matrix(...)) and creating 
the special makeCacheMatrix object in a second step (e.g. x <- makeCacheMatrix(x)).
However, the set of functions works, when the matrix is created in one step.

## Example
I used this example to verify the functionality:
x <- makeCacheMatrix(matrix(c(1,2,2,3),2,2))
cacheSolve(x)
      [,1] [,2]
[1,]   -3    2
[2,]    2   -1
cacheSolve(x)
getting cached data
      [,1] [,2]
[1,]   -3    2
[2,]    2   -1

PS: you can also try x <- makeCacheMatrix(matrix(rnorm(25),5,5)), but I don't want to verify the result by hand. ;)

Thanks for your peer review!
